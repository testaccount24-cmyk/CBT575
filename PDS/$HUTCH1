Sam,

        I am sending you several REXX edit macros that I have
found useful in dealing with the Unix System Services file
system.  We have several USS Datasets from which our Dealers
download HTML code to be displayed on their connected PCs.  These
files are kept in ASCII format and some times I have been called
upon to view these files through TSO/ISPF OEDIT or ISH utilities.
These macros have made it unnecessary to FTP to a PC and look at
it there.  The following REXX Edit macros make it easy to
translate from ASCII to EBCDIC and back.

1: EXAMHTM - creates a temporary file that is translated to
             EBCDIC.  It depends on ASCEBC macro.  Builds a
             temporary file for safety.

2: ASCEBC  - translates the edited file to EBCDIC.

3: EBCASC  - translates the edited file to ASCII.

        Note that these macros do not check the actual file type.
If the file is already ASCII and you use EBCASC against it, you
have just encrypted and possibly corrupted it.
