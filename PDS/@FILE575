//***FILE 575 is from Thomas Hutchins, and contains a JES2 spool    *   FILE 575
//*           offload utility which allows you to read the data     *   FILE 575
//*           directly off the JES2 SPOOL OFFLOAD datasets, so      *   FILE 575
//*           you don't have to restore it on a JES2 system first,  *   FILE 575
//*           to retrieve the data.  The program is called          *   FILE 575
//*           SPOOLSEL, and it has some other utility capabilities  *   FILE 575
//*           having to do with JES2 SPOOL OFFLOAD files, on tape   *   FILE 575
//*           or on disk.                                           *   FILE 575

//*           Also included are 3 edit macros which allow quick     *   FILE 575
//*           translation and viewing of data from ASCII to EBCDIC, *   FILE 575
//*           EBCDIC to ASCII, and EXAMHTM, which creates a         *   FILE 575
//*           temporary file for safety, when you use ASCEBC.       *   FILE 575
//*                                                                 *   FILE 575
//*           Descriptions of these macros are written below the    *   FILE 575
//*           following descriptions for SPOOLSEL.                  *   FILE 575

//*      I am sending you 2 files which contain an updated          *   FILE 575
//*      "SHARE" utility which allows you to list what is on a      *   FILE 575
//*      JES2 offloaded data set, print any or all the contents     *   FILE 575
//*      of a JES2 offloaded data set or create a JES2 offloaded    *   FILE 575
//*      data set from multiple JES2 offloaded data sets.           *   FILE 575
//*                                                                 *   FILE 575
//*      We use this to store our product installation printouts    *   FILE 575

//*      I am sending you several REXX edit macros that I have      *   FILE 575
//*      found useful in dealing with the Unix System Services      *   FILE 575
//*      file system.  We have several USS Datasets from which      *   FILE 575
//*      our Dealers download HTML code to be displayed on their    *   FILE 575
//*      connected PCs.  These files are kept in ASCII format       *   FILE 575
//*      and some times I have been called upon to view these       *   FILE 575
//*      files through TSO/ISPF OEDIT or ISH utilities.  These      *   FILE 575
//*      macros have made it unnecessary to FTP to a PC and look    *   FILE 575
//*      at it there.  The following REXX Edit macros make it       *   FILE 575
//*      easy to translate from ASCII to EBCDIC and back.           *   FILE 575
//*                                                                 *   FILE 575
//*      1: EXAMHTM - creates a temporary file that is translated   *   FILE 575
//*                   to EBCDIC.  It depends on ASCEBC macro.       *   FILE 575
//*                   Builds a temporary file for safety.           *   FILE 575

//*      2: ASCEBC  - translates the edited file to EBCDIC.         *   FILE 575
//*                                                                 *   FILE 575
//*      3: EBCASC  - translates the edited file to ASCII.          *   FILE 575
//*                                                                 *   FILE 575
//*      Note that these macros do not check the actual file        *   FILE 575
//*      type.  If the file is already ASCII and you use EBCASC     *   FILE 575
//*      against it, you have just encrypted and possibly           *   FILE 575
//*      corrupted it.                                              *   FILE 575
